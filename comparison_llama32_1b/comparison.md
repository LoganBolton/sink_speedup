# Attention Sink Analysis Comparison

## Sequence Length Comparison

### Short Sequence (Length: 2)
- **Total heads:** 512
- **Sink heads:** 366 (71.48%)
- **Correlation:** 74.04%

### Long Sequence (Length: 24)
- **Total heads:** 512
- **Sink heads:** 117 (22.85%)
- **Correlation:** 26.67%

## Key Findings

1. **Impact of Sequence Length:**
   - Sink heads percentage decreases by 48.63% as sequence length increases
   - Correlation decreases by 47.37% as sequence length increases

2. **Optimization Potential:**
   - For short sequences (length 2), there's strong potential to optimize by copying attention patterns 
     (74.04% heads would correctly be predicted as sinks)
   - For longer sequences (length 24), this optimization would be less effective 
     (only 26.67% would be predicted correctly)

3. **Sequence Length Threshold:**
   - The significant drop suggests a threshold effect where attention patterns become more complex beyond
     a certain sequence length
   - Hybrid approaches may be needed for longer sequences

## Conclusion

The analysis supports the hypothesis that attention sink patterns are more consistent across layers
for shorter sequences. For practical optimization, a dynamic approach could be used:
1. Use pattern copying for short sequences where correlation is high
2. Use traditional computation for longer sequences
3. Potentially investigate a mixed approach where some heads use pattern copying and others use full computation
